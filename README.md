### Hello y`all ðŸ‘‹

My name is Tomek, I`m frontend developer working in-studio on projects and startups for small and big companies. I create clean, holistically simple and useful design. Iâ€™m interested in researching, prototyping, designing, and building practical, purpose-driven digital services. Iâ€™m a JAMstack fan. Itâ€™s a way of building websites and apps for better performance â€” lower scaling costs, providing higher security, and offering a better developer experience.
